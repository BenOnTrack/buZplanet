Always add proper event handlers for accessibility (onclick must have onkeydown), add ARIA roles for interactive elements, clean up unused CSS selectors, ensure all interactive elements follow accessibility guidelines, and always associate form labels with controls using proper id/for attributes or wrap controls within labels. Use <span> or other semantic elements instead of <label> for non-form display labels.
